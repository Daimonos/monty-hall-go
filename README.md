# The Monty Hall Problem

I was watching Brooklyn 99 and they were talking about the monty hall problem. I had no idea what it was so looked it up.

If you're interested - look here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem

# Setting up

```
$ git clone https://bitbucket.org/jimdhughes/monty-hall-go
$ cd monty-hall-go
$ go run main.go
```

It'll print out the scenarios and the stats at the end.

Lo and behold: It IS beneficial to switch - given the behavioural criteria of Monty :)
